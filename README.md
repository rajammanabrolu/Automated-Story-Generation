Test data from the AAAI 2018 paper "Event Representations for Automated Story Generation with Deep Neural Nets" by Lara J. Martin, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Xinyu Wang, William Hancock, Shruti Singh, Brent Harrison, Mark O. Riedl

The data is in the Data folder in the form of a split gzipped tarball. To access the gzipped tarball please run
```
cat Data/EventRepresentationDataRelease* > EventRepresentationDataRelease.tar.gz
```

Event-to-Event and Event-to-Sentence files can be found in their respective folders. Within each, data files are located in folders that are numbered in the order that they are presented in the paper. Each of these nested folders contains files for test input, expected test output, and generated output (labeled accordingly).

Please contact Lara (ljmartin@gatech.edu) or Raj (raj.ammanabrolu@gatech.edu) if you have any questions regarding the data. Xinyu "Lilly" (lillywang1126@gatech.edu) can address specific questions on the S+P sentence data.
